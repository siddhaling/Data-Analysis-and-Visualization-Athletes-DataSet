# EDA_Forbes-Data-set
## Carried out by Prarthanaa Sankaranarayanan and Manisha Ann Thomas under my supervision

Our dataset consists of a complete list of the world’s highest-paid athletes since Forbes's first list in 1990. The dataset consists of records from 1990 - 2020. In the model that will be made we can:

Name: Name of each of the athletes
Nationality: Nationality of each of the athletes
Current Rank: 
Previous Year Rank:
Sport: The sport played by each of the athletes
Year: The year the sport was played by each of the athletes
Earnings ($millions): The amount received by each athletes in the respective year

Packages and libraries used
Project Jupyter is a project and community whose goal is to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.

## NumPy:
NumPy is a Python package. It stands for ‘Numerical Python’. It is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing of array. NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently. This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures. NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.\
## Pandas: 
pandas are a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. Pandas allows importing data from various file formats such as comma-separated values, JSON, SQL, and Microsoft Excel. Pandas allows various data manipulation operations such as merging, reshaping, selecting, as well as data cleaning, and data wrangling features.\
## Matplotlib:
It is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK. There is also a procedural "pylab" interface based on a state machine (like OpenGL), designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB, though its use is discouraged. SciPy makes use of Matplotlib.\
## Seaborn:
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures.\
Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data. Its dataset-oriented, declarative API lets you focus on what the different elements of your plots mean, rather than on the details of how to draw them.

## Methods and techniques used
Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA is used by data scientists to manipulate data sources and to discover patterns and anomalies, test a hypothesis and check assumptions

1.	Identification of variables and data types
2.	Analyzing the basic metrics
3.	Non-Graphical Univariate Analysis
4.	Graphical Univariate Analysis
5.	Bivariate Analysis
6.	Variable transformations
7.	Missing value treatment
8.	Outlier treatment
9.	Correlation Analysis
10.	Dimensionality Reduction
